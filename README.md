# About
**Zed** is roblox open source explorer made using the Fusion ui framework.

# Usage
Not supposed to be used right now, so no release build for now, but you can still try it by cloning the repository, serving it with the **Rojo** command: `rojo serve`, and previewing the UI with the **UI Labs** plugin.

# Features
* Customizable themes
* Different icon packs for instances

# Contributing
The UI is made using the Fusion framework and the [UI Labs](https://ui-labs.luau.page/docs/getstarted) Plugin for previewing in Roblox Studio.

### Example studio workflow
